                <p class="card-text">
                  The fundamental cause of obesity and overweight is an energy
                  imbalance between calories consumed and calories expended.
                  Globally, there has been: an increased intake of energy-dense
                  foods that are high in fat and sugars; and an increase in
                  physical inactivity due to the increasingly sedentary nature
                  of many forms of work, changing modes of transportation, and
                  increasing urbanization. Changes in dietary and physical
                  activity patterns are often the result of environmental and
                  societal changes associated with development and lack of
                  supportive policies in sectors such as health, agriculture,
                  transport, urban planning, environment, food processing,
                  distribution, marketing, and education.

                <p class="card-text">
                  Overweight and obesity, as well as their related
                  noncommunicable diseases, are largely preventable. Supportive
                  environments and communities are fundamental in shaping
                  peopleâ€™s choices, by making the choice of healthier foods and
                  regular physical activity the easiest choice (the choice that
                  is the most accessible, available and affordable), and
                  therefore preventing overweight and obesity. At the individual
                  level, people can: limit energy intake from total fats and
                  sugars; increase consumption of fruit and vegetables, as well
                  as legumes, whole grains and nuts; and engage in regular
                  physical activity (60 minutes a day for children and 150
                  minutes spread through the week for adults). Individual
                  responsibility can only have its full effect where people have
                  access to a healthy lifestyle. Therefore, at the societal
                  level it is important to support individuals in following the
                  recommendations above, through sustained implementation of
                  evidence based and population based policies that make regular
                  physical activity and healthier dietary choices available,
                  affordable and easily accessible to everyone, particularly to
                  the poorest individuals. An example of such a policy is a tax
                  on sugar sweetened beverages.
